                    <p class="legal-intro">
                        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of the website, products, software
                        platforms, biological services, and related offerings (collectively, the “Services”) provided by

                    <p>
                        By accessing the website, submitting biological samples, purchasing products, enrolling in
                        research or clinical programs, or otherwise using the Services, you acknowledge that you have

                        and any applicable informed consent documents, clinical protocols, or study agreements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Services following
                        publication of updated Terms constitutes acceptance of such changes.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jivanu operates in the field of microbiome science and therapeutics and provides services that
                        may
                        include biological sample collection, microbiome sequencing and analysis (including 16S rRNA
                        sequencing), microbiome reports and analytics, live biotherapeutic products, engineered or
                        modified microbial formulations, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), defined microbial
                        consortia, investigational and clinical trial services, and associated software, logistics, and
                        research support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain Services are investigational, experimental, or offered only within regulatory or
                        research frameworks and may not be approved for general clinical or commercial use.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        By using the Services, you represent that you are legally capable of providing informed consent,
                        that all information you provide is accurate and complete, and that you comply with applicable
                        laws and eligibility criteria. Access to specific Services may be restricted based on medical,
                        regulatory, ethical, or geographic considerations.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. No Medical Advice</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unless expressly stated in a written clinical agreement, information provided through the
                        Services does not constitute medical advice. Microbiome data and analyses may be informational
                        or investigational in nature. You should consult a licensed healthcare professional before
                        making medical decisions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>5. Clinical, Investigational, and IND Services</h2>
                    <p>
                        Certain Services may be provided under investigational or clinical trial frameworks, including
                        Investigational New Drug (IND) or equivalent regulatory authorizations. Participation is
                        voluntary and subject to eligibility screening, regulatory oversight, and execution of
                        informed consent documentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You acknowledge that investigational interventions may not provide therapeutic benefit and may
                        involve known or unknown risks. Outcomes are not guaranteed, and the science of the microbiome
                        continues to evolve.
                    </p>

                    <h2>6. Biological Samples</h2>
                    <p>
                        By submitting biological samples, you acknowledge that proper collection and handling are
                        essential for safety and analytical accuracy. Samples may be rejected if quality, regulatory,
                        or protocol requirements are not met.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Samples may be processed, stored, transferred, retained, or destroyed in accordance with
                        applicable law, regulatory obligations, approved protocols, and your informed consent. Limited
                        rights to use samples are granted solely to perform the Services, quality control, regulatory
                        compliance, and approved research activities.
                    </p>

                    <h2>7. Research and Data Use</h2>
                    <p>
                        Data generated through the Services may be used for research and development, validation of
                        diagnostics or therapeutics, regulatory submissions, and scientific publication. Such use will
                        rely on de-identified or anonymized data unless explicit consent or legal authorization permits
                        otherwise.
                    </p>
